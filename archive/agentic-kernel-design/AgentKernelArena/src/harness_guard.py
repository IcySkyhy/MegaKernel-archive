"""Workspace integrity guard for task harness files.

Agents should optimize kernels, not the measurement harness.  This module
records a digest snapshot of task-owned harness files before an agent runs and
verifies that those files are unchanged before scoring.

Note that the protected set is defined by naming patterns, not only by location, so a
file an agent creates anywhere in the workspace can fall inside it.  Such files are
discarded rather than treated as tampering; see ``verify_workspace_harness``.
