"""Fused FP8 grouped MLP, driven through its public op.

``grouped_mlp_fp8`` runs fc1 with the silu-gated activation fused into its
epilogue and fc2 after it, which is only worth doing if it agrees with doing
the pieces separately. So the op is driven end to end -- output and all four
gradients -- against an eager per-expert reference computed in fp32.

Two fp8 quantisations sit on that path, the input and the fc1 activation, and
the backward adds its own. That is what puts the SNR floor here well below a
single GEMM's; the threshold only has to catch a wrong answer, not the
quantisation. Which backend answers is decided by the device rather than the
caller: FlyDSL takes the fused path where it is supported, Triton covers the
rest.
