"""flash_attn backward kernel builders for FlyDSL (gfx950 / MI355X).

Three deterministic kernels -- odo (identity delta), dkdv (KV-outer), dq
(Q-outer). Each work-group owns one output tile and writes it once, so there
are no float atomics. Built on the verified forward machine.

    """Fold the fused kernel's dQ split-K partials: DQ[b,q] = sm * Sum_b' WSQ[b',b,q].

    Only the bands a q row causally sees (b' <= q/BLOCK_KV) are read, in ascending
    order and with an fp32 accumulator, so the result is bitwise reproducible without
    atomics. One pass replaces torch's sum -> mul_ -> cast chain, which materialises an
    fp32 [B, BLOCK_KV*Hq*D] temporary per q group and touches it three more times.

    Under ``varlen`` the partials are packed by q TOKEN ([bands, total_q, Hq*D], built with
    batch_size=1 and seq_len_q=total_q so the band stride follows the workspace), and which
    bands a row sees comes from its OWN segment: the band window is derived per row from
    cu_seqlens rather than from one compile-time Sq and causal offset. A work-group then
    owns a SINGLE row, since a segment's token base carries no alignment and two
    consecutive packed rows can straddle a segment boundary without sharing a band window.
    That costs nothing: the work-group count is rows*Hq*D/chunk however the rows are split.

    A work-group owns ``rows_per_wg`` q rows (one q group, hence one band count) and
    every thread carries ``uc`` independent 16 B chunks, so that many loads per band are
    in flight -- the band loop is dynamic and cannot be unrolled. ``lpt`` matters for the
    work-group width; every (block, uc, lpt) combination returns bit-identical dQ, so
    these are pure rate knobs: pick one by what it costs the co-resident body below, not by
    its own rate.

    ITS OWN RATE IS NOT WHAT TO TUNE FOR, THOUGH: this kernel runs CO-RESIDENT with the
    fused body (see _fused_pipelined), so what it really costs is the registers it takes
    out of the shared 512-dword pool. ``uc`` is that price -- a thread holds uc fp32
    accumulators of VEC plus uc loads in flight, so uc directly sets the per-wave
    allocation. Whether a smaller uc is worth its slower per-call rate depends entirely
    on whether the dwords it frees let a SECOND reduce wave co-reside per SIMD, which is
    a hard threshold effect (one more wave fitting is a step function, not a smooth
    trade), so the reduce's own latency barely matters: it runs mostly hidden inside the
    much longer fused kernel regardless of shape.

    The deciding equation is ceil8(alloc_body) + n*alloc_reduce <= 512, where alloc_body
    is whatever the fused kernel (see build_flash_attn_bwd_fused / g3_kreg / g1_ks_outer)
    currently allocates. Every uc/vec choice here must be re-verified against that
    equation whenever the fused body's own allocation changes, since a verdict taken at
    one alloc_body does not transfer to another -- crossing the 512 boundary evicts a
    wave outright rather than degrading gradually. The currently deployed uc favors
    fitting one FAST co-resident wave over one SLOW one, which measured strictly better
    than either the extra-wave attempt or the pre-donation baseline; re-run the sweep
    (interleaved against a baseline, not a lone number) before trusting a change here.

    Adding a THIRD wave is a measured LOSS, from both sides of the equation. The body
    sits at 455 dwords, so ceil8 456 + 2*24 leaves 56 -- two waves with 8 to spare, and a
    third needs 24 more. Donating them from the body costs more than the wave returns
    (k_reg=0 -> 434 dwords and -0.49%, g3_kreg=0 -> 428 and -2.0%, both on 32-sample
    same-process A/B), and shrinking the wave instead costs the same (rows_per_wg=1
    -0.14%, and uc=2 on the g3_kreg body -7.6%). Run alone this kernel already streams at
    the machine roofline, so extra waves cannot shorten it; they only take DRAM and issue
    from the body beside them. Treat two waves as the operating point and spend any future
    donation on the band width instead (see _fuse_blockkv_for).

    Only the LAST pipeline chunk's reduce runs with nothing beside it, so that one may
    legally take a different (wider, faster-standalone) shape -- a chunk owns a disjoint
    element slice, and uc/block partition elements rather than reordering a slot's band
    sum, so mixing shapes across launches is still bitwise identical. Measured: not a
    gain, because the tail dispatch is a small fraction of the whole call regardless of
    per-thread load count, so its co-resident slowdown (which does not apply to it in
    the first place, since nothing else runs beside it) was never the real cost.

    The dQ STORE is non-temporal: dQ is not read again in the backward, so keeping it in
    L2/MALL only evicts the dO the fused kernel re-reads once per band. It is not a general
    lever: on the fused kernel's own partial store the whole CPol space measured worse than
    the default cached policy, so a stream that something downstream re-reads keeps it.

    The partial READ keeps it too, and that was re-checked rather than assumed: this kernel
    runs CO-RESIDENT with the producer that wrote those partials, so dropping nt to let the
    just-written lines stay resident looks free, but it measured D128 797.8 THD / 757.1 SBHD
    against 810.6 / 774.4 with nt (D64 arm flat) -- the partial stream is far larger than
    any cache level, so retaining it only displaces the Q/dO the producer is re-reading.

    band group to the next, or None when the whole band axis fits one workspace.

    ``ilv`` adjacent bands share a row and are interleaved at D granularity rather than
    getting a slab each; ``ilv=1`` is the plain [bands, B, Sq, Hq*D]. See _WSQ_BAND_ILV
    for why, and _wsq_ilv for what bounds it.

    Its D axis is PERMUTED, and both writer and reader must agree: within each aligned
    32-element run, element ``dperm`` holds real D index
    ``d = (dperm & ~31) | ((dperm & 24) >> 1) | ((dperm & 4) << 2) | (dperm & 3)``,
    i.e. bit 4 of D sits at bit 2 of the stored position. That is exactly the order the
    dQ^T MFMA C-layout hands a pair of D-tiles to a lane, so the fused kernel's partial
    store covers a full 64 B of a q row per instruction instead of 32 B (see the store in
    _gemm3_tiles), and the reduce below un-permutes on its own store side. Measured with
    TCP_TCC counters: this roughly halves TCP->TCC write requests at unchanged DRAM
    traffic (byte-identical reads/EA-writes), which shows up as a clock-leg gain on a
    kernel already close to the power cap rather than a per-cycle efficiency change.

    One slot per kv band, so a band's contribution to a q row is written by exactly one
    work-group (no atomics, bitwise-reproducible). Cached, since the full workspace is
    far too large to reallocate per call. The causal trim means only ~half of it is ever
    touched, and that read is bandwidth-bound, so it can only be made cheaper in BYTES,
    or hidden. Folding band pairs by letting one band ACCUMULATE INTO its partner's slot
    does not remove bytes: the accumulating band still has to read that slot, which only
    trades dqred reads for dkdv reads (net loss). Folding them by giving one work-group
    both bands does remove bytes, and is priced further down.

    WHAT THESE BYTES COST, measured by subtraction on the scored shape (D128, 6.78 ms):
    dropping the partial store alone takes the wall to 4.91 ms and dropping the reduce
    with it to 4.18 ms, while D64's own compute phase doubled is 4.25 ms. So the fused
    D128 body is ALREADY at D64's per-flop efficiency everywhere except this workspace --
    the whole remaining gap is these partials, and nothing else in the body is worth
    attacking until they shrink. Splitting the store cost further: writing the partials to
    a single aliased slab (wrong dQ, pricing only) recovers 0.60 ms, so ~1.06 ms of it is
    memory traffic (~0.12 ms/GB at 8.7 GB, well under the 0.161 ms/GB roofline price
    because it overlaps compute) and ~0.79 ms is GEMM3 plus store issue. Halving the
    partial count is therefore worth ~0.9 ms on the write side plus a MEASURED 0.34 ms on
    the read side (running the reduce over half as many bands), i.e. ~+18%.

    Folding the pair IN REGISTERS instead -- one work-group owning two adjacent bands and
    writing a q row's slot once -- does halve the slots and both request counts, but it is
    priced by the dK/dV accumulators, not by dQ, and either loop ordering needs them live
    twice over. The accumulator is BLOCK_KV*D*2/256 = 128 dwords at bkv=128 and is
    invariant to how the work is split across waves, q blocks or heads, so a pair costs a
    flat +128 dwords against the 52 this body has spare (460 of 512, with two 24-dword
    reduce waves in the rest). Nothing smaller than that buys the fold: q-outer needs both
    bands live across the q block, band-outer cannot share the dQ accumulator at all, and
    flushing the second band's dK/dV to LDS or to a slot per q block costs orders of
    magnitude more traffic than the partials it saves. Halving these request counts
    therefore needs a fold whose unit is NOT a second dK/dV accumulator set. The routes
    that survive that constraint all pay in RECOMPUTE -- e.g. one work-group owning the
    pair's dK and dQ while a sibling owns its dV, which duplicates only GEMM1 (+20% flops
    for -1.25 ms) -- so the next round's job is to price that recompute against the
    compute phase, not to re-attempt the register fold.

    Hiding it is what pays, and it is a REGISTER question, not a scheduling one. An
    eight-wave fused work-group fills its SIMDs solid, so no dqred wave can land beside
    it and a dependency-free two-stream arm barely overlaps at all. The four-wave
    geometry (see _fused_pipelined) leaves enough of the 512-dword pool free for the
    reduce's waves to co-reside per SIMD, and that overlap is where the real win is.

    So the fused body's register allocation is priced by what the SIBLING kernel needs,
    not by this kernel's own spill, and the budget is negotiable from BOTH sides: a body
    change that looks like a pure ISA improvement (fewer spills) can still lose if it
    pushes the allocation past the point where two reduce waves fit per SIMD, and a leaner
    reduce (fewer per-thread accumulators, see build_flash_attn_bwd_dqred_module) can buy
    back headroom the body spent elsewhere. Rule of thumb before spending a register on
    either kernel: check whether 512 - waves_per_simd(body)*alloc(body) still covers
    n*alloc(dqred) for the co-resident wave count you want -- dump both kernels' VGPR/AGPR
    counts first, since "spill == 0" alone no longer proves an arm has passed once two
    kernels share the pool. The permuted store above costs a modest AGPR
    increase on the fused body and still wins outright at the resulting allocation; buying
    a second reduce wave back after that is not worth it here since no available register
    donor is large enough to clear the threshold without a body-side regression.

    A kv band only writes the q rows that causally see it, so the bands ABOVE q's own
    band hold stale data and are skipped -- which is also what keeps the traffic at the
    causal half. Fixed band order and fp32 accumulation -> bitwise deterministic.

    ``scale`` is 1/log2e, not sm_scale: the fused kernel's fifth GEMM contracts against
    the LDS K tile, which is staged already prescaled by sm*log2e for GEMM1a.

    Band count is what this costs, and on the fused D128 body it is ALL that is left.
    Widening the reduce's band unit N-fold so it reads 1/N of the bands (diagnostic only,
    wrong dQ) prices it exactly linear in bytes on the scored shape: 8.72 GB -> 6.569 ms,
    4.36 -> 6.186, 2.18 -> 6.002, none -> 5.749, i.e. 0.086 ms per logical GB with no
    fixed part, which is 6.0 TB/s over the ~50% of those bytes that miss cache = the
    fabric roofline. Two consequences worth keeping:
      * with the reduce off the D128 body runs 956.5 TF against the D64 fused arm's
        915.9 -- the BODY is already 1.04x D64 per flop, so no lever inside it can close
        the score gap because the gap is not there;
      * closing the remaining gap needs -0.55 of these 0.82 ms, i.e. a third fewer
        partial bytes or a third more cache absorption. Absorption is capacity-bound
        (1.07 GB pipeline chunk against a 256 MB MALL), so the byte count is the

    A split owns the q blocks with (q/BLOCK_Q) % q_split == split only if every band
    starts on a q_split boundary; otherwise the split -> q-block map depends on the band
    and a sub-range launch would leave those rows half-summed (the SNR shape's narrower
    band is exactly that case), so the cut is only legal when the band divides evenly --
    or when the body re-phases its walk onto the absolute map itself (_qsp_absolute,
    which is how the D128 band gets its cut back).

    Cutting is not free: each chunk is its own dispatch, so its stragglers drain against
    an emptying machine instead of against the next chunk's work, and the grid is what
    prices that drain. A chunk holds ``(Skv/block_kv)*Hkv*n_qsp`` work-groups, so HALVING
    the band doubles them at equal n_qsp. That is the whole difference between the two
    head dims: on D64's 256-row band a quarter-batch chunk hands each CU a single
    work-group, the round's makespan goes to the longest band against a much lower mean,
    and only the last batch, only in half, wins; D128's 128-row band reaches the same
    work-groups-per-CU at n_qsp=1, so every batch can be cut to single splits. Measured
    at D128/bkv128/q_split=4 (D64 arm flat, 932-937 TF): n_qsp=1 on every batch 782.8 /
    781.7 TF vs 770.2 / 767.1 for the D64-shaped last-batch-half cut, and 776.9 for
    n_qsp=2 on every batch.

    SBHD can only cut the SPLIT axis (batch None). A q_split sub-range is a pure grid
    restriction, so unlike a batch chunk it needs no contiguous per-batch slice of Q/dO/
    K/V -- which seq-major SBHD cannot give -- and the partials of the q blocks a split
    owns are complete the moment that split retires, in every batch at once.

    A finite window pins q_split=1, so the split axis degenerates to one chunk and there is
    no axis left worth cutting: what a window buys is a WIDE band, and a wide band is exactly
    what leaves a batch too few work-groups to fill the CU array even once. Cutting the batch
    on top of that hands each CU a fraction of a work-group and pays a ramp-up and a drain per
    batch, while the reduce it would hide fits beside the body's own work-groups anyway, so a
    windowed SBHD shape keeps the single whole-batch dispatch.

    The reduce is pure DRAM at the roofline while the fused kernel only uses 2.4 of the
    6.2 TB/s, so the reduce costs wall time only while nothing else is running. Two axes
    cut both kernels: BATCH -- a kv band owns a slice of dQ for its OWN batch only, so
    batch b's partials are complete the moment batch b's dkdv retires -- and the q_split
    SUBSET, once the body's q walk is on the absolute map (see _pipe_chunks). A batch chunk
    cuts the delta pass with it, so all but the first delta moves off the critical path into
    the first fused dispatch; a split chunk shares the whole batch and issues them together.

    Where the wall time goes, from the kernel trace: almost all of it is fused dispatches
    (the first one alone, then the rest with a reduce hidden beside them), plus a small
    uncoverable head (the lse prescale and batch 0's delta, which the first chunk reads),
    a handful of dispatch-boundary bubbles (the event that fences a chunk off from its
    reduce is an HSA barrier packet), and one exposed tail (the last reduce, with the
    dk/dv slot reduce running beside it). So the fused body dominates the wall and
    everything the host layer still owns is small, most of which is already hidden.

    A batch chunk's arguments are per-batch slices of the same buffers. The kernels'
    workspace strides are build-time constants of the FULL batch (dQ partials stride by
    ``batch_size`` bands, dk/dv slots by ``Q_SPLIT``), so a slice addresses exactly the
    rows the whole-batch launch would have given it -- same bands, same ascending order,
    same fp32 accumulator, hence bitwise-identical dQ/dK/dV.

    The chunks stay on ONE fused stream even though they are independent (a chunk owns its
    own batch, and where the last batch is cut its own q_split subset, so its dk/dv slots
    and dQ partial rows are disjoint from every other chunk's). Alternating them across
    two streams to fill each dispatch's causal drain is a measured LOSS: the overlap is
    real, but it is the overlap itself that costs -- two chunks in flight means two
    batches' Q/dO/K/V resident at once, which widens the cache footprint enough (on this
    kernel and its neighbouring odo/slot-reduce dispatches) to cost more than the drain
    it was meant to hide.

    Returns the event the caller must join before reading dQ; the dk/dv slot reduce is
    independent of dQ and is meant to be enqueued in front of that join.

    ``cu`` switches the same walk onto a RAGGED batch, where the bands are per segment and the
    rows are packed q tokens. A group then owns bands [lo, lo+span) OF EVERY SEGMENT: the
    segments occupy disjoint rows of each slot, so one writer per slot survives untouched, and
    a segment whose kv length stops below the group simply has no live tile there. Because the
    kv extent comes from cu_seqlens rather than from the group, the span need not tile the band
    axis -- the last group's surplus bands sit above every segment and retire empty.

    The groups run back to back on ONE stream. A second set of slots would let a group's reduce
    run beside the next group's body, but at this context the body already has the memory system
    saturated writing its own partials, so the two only contend; the slots buy more as a longer
    group, which is what shrinks the carry.
